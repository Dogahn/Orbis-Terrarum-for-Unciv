Orbis Terrarum Unciv v1

A translation of the great Civ6 Orbis Terrarum Redux map by Skylar Saphyr

It has been cropped to Large Hex in Unciv, losing about 15-16 tiles from every side.  This means you can't play with world wrap, and you can't sail around the world.  Effectively this is an inland sea map.  I've gone through and added many True Start Locations and a few Approximates.

OrbisTerrarumUnciv: Map adapted to Unciv civilizations (Babylon instead of Sumeria, No Macedonia, etc)
OrbisTerrarumUncivAC: Map with additional start locations for the addition Civilizations from the Ancient Civilizations Mod.

Some Replayability tips:
- Load in Map Editor
- Go to Generate
- Switch to Partial
- Generate Resources to remix the resources.
- -Generate Wonders if you want to see more of them.
- -Generate Ancient Ruins if you'd like to have goodie huts.

I see Continent ID, but do not know how to access it outside of the generatior yet.  I do regret not doing the entire map, but this one is already large enough to lag my PC in testing.
